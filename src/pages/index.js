            I'm motivated by solving hard problems and creating interfaces that
            offer a great user experience. I strive to build products that have a purpose, delight users, and empower
            them to do more with technology.

            , a self directed retreat for programmers. There I was able to explore how to make programming more
            accessible and human, played around with some lower-level languages, worked on some generative art projects and paired
            with lots of great people.

          I was interested in exploring programming through movement. I built a code editor that uses gestures to navigate and edit a snippet of code, similar to vim commands.          </ContentBody>

          One of the ways I learned how to program was by building games in the browser. They provided me with immediate feedback, on the screen, and dealt with enough complexity to help me reason about fundamental concepts.

          I was curious about functional programming and decided to build a clone of the breakout game using four different paradigms; vanilla JS, functional JS, Elm, and Rust (wasm). I used automated tests, with Jest and Puppeteer, to measure the code execution time of each game and map it to the speed of the ball, creating a visual of execution time between each implementation.

            Having worked in the identity space over the last couple of years I
            wondered how we could make the verification process more human and
            allow the user to see their identity. At a recent hackathon,
            together with a Product Designer at Onfido Fabien Mahe, we created generative
            art print using face detection data.
